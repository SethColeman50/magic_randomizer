Idea: Magic Deck Randomizer

- scryfall api
- basic oauth to save your collection of cards (and maybe decks)

Database
- mongodb
- saves passwords and decks
- hash passwords in database

Front end
- hover over different cards to show image
- importer for cards you own

our api
- GET random deck
- GET saved deck
- POST past random deck

Documentation:
https://scryfall.com/docs/api

Goals for monday:
- Mongo saves and gets a sample decklist from the test frontend
- Basic Oauth (might want to wait for monday when coleman goes over it)
- Running on AWS
